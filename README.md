# MiniErb

The mini_erb gem is another spin off from the mysh project. In testing the
handlebars embedded Ruby system used there, it was observed that the test
code was faster than both the native erb and the faster erubi.

The mini_erb gem returns to the syntax of erb based on the same algorithm of
the mysh handlebars.

In performance it is still faster. This is laid out in this
[report](https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/mini_erb/blob/master/docs/embbed_ruby_study.pdf)
.

#### Differences from erb.

For reasons of speed, mini_erb supports a subset of the functionality of erb.
The following lays out the differences:

* The suppression of new lines with a tag ending in -&#37;> is active by default.
* The use of code lines starting with a % sign is not supported. Instead use
<%  ... %> embedded code blocks.
* In erb, <%% maps to <%. In mini_erb use <\&#37; instead. The same goes for
%%> which is replaced by \&#37;>.
